# Rendebs

This is a subset of my larger project called Rendezvous.  it is much simpler and uses bootstrap 4 and css flexbox for responsive behaviour.  I tried the angular/flex-layout package but it created version dependencies, so I removed it and used straight css for flex.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Dependencies
nodejs
Internet connection


## Intial Setup
Angular 2 and higher projects have a multitude of dependencies that are not stored in the reposiory at github.  So, once the repository is obtained, it will be necessary to unzip it and then issue the following commands.  The process of npm retrieving all the dependencies my take considerable time.

npm install


## Build
